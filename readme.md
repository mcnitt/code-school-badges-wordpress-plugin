# Code School Badges Wordpress Plugin

Provides both widgets and shortcodes to help display Code School profile badges on your WordPress site

## Description  
Learn By Doing. Code School teaches web technologies in the comfort of your browser with video lessons, coding challenges, and screencasts. Use this plugin to proudly display completed Code School course badges on your WordPress blog, website or CV. 

You can use a widget to display your badges in a header, sidebar or footer or use a shortcode to display badges in the main content area of a post or page. The plugin offers two customization options:

1. How many of your most recent completed course badges to display
2. How large should each badge be (in pixels, ems, or other valid units)
